Interactive charts for assisting judgements vs. sample data


This project was completed as part of the U.Mich specialisation: 'Applied Data Science with Python' on Coursera.
It builds on the work described in the paper below, about the challenges making judgements based on sample generated data (which contain an element of probability).
There are 3 solutions presented below in this notebook:
1) A 'static' chart, with a preset 'y-test value'
2) An interactive chart with a single y-test value, which can be adjusted by clicking on the chart, and adjusts the sample bar colours based on probability that the y-test value is representative of their population
3) An interactive chart with 2 y-test values, which adjusts the bar colour based on the the probability that the population mean lies between the two values

Movies of the interactivity for the 1 line and 2 line charts are also included
